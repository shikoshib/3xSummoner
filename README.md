# 3xSummoner
A message box generator that uses native Windows API, intended for use on Windows 3.1.

In case you're wondering, this program works up to Windows 7, since it's the last Windows version to support Win16 applications.

Sorry if the code is a bit messy, I'm just a beginner to C.

# Requirements
* [Borland Turbo C++ v4.5](https://winworldpc.com/product/turbo-c/45-win) to compile the entire code
* and i think that's it
